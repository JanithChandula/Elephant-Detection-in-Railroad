# Elephant-Detection-in-Railroad
Elephant detection system for trains  using node-mcu 
This project is implemented using 2 node-mcus connected by mqtt protocol.
pir sensor, 3 ultrasound sensors used to detect the motion of the animal. Then messege is transmitted by node mcu at that premise to the node-mcu in train using mqtt. Therefore train driver will be able to detect the elephant before entering 500m radius circle arround the animal.
